# SelfList

A personal to-list for anyone that wants to focus on effective self-management.

## App Definition Statement

SelfList is a personal to-do list app centered around a different paradigm. Task management is not about completing the most urgent tasks every day; it is about completing the most important tasks every week. SelfList helps you focus on those weekly important tasks by providing a new perspective on task management. Each task is categorized into a role, where each role corresponds to an important aspect of your life, such as family member, student, co-worker, and friend. Completed tasks within a role corresponds to investment in that role, while incomplete tasks indicate a lack of focus. SelfList ensures that incomplete tasks will be at the forefront of your mind so you can balance out investment to your various roles. SelfList can be used for balancing work and personal life, managing different jobs at the same time, and developing consistent relationships.
